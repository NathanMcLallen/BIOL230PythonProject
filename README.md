# BIOL230PythonProject

Part A:
McLallenNM_OsX_A4PartA.py prints the ratio of acidic and basic codons and the number of trinucleotide repeats for each gene in the YeastGenes folder
Requires YeastGenes folder (too many files for github) to be in the same directory as the program. Other dependencies are the same as the original MyGeneParser. 

Part B: 
McLallenNM_OsX_A4PartB.py goes through the Augustus and GenScan gene prediction data of the Drosophila melanogaster genome linked below and creates a scatterplot of predicted gene length vs predicted number of exons in a pdf. Also creates a CSV file with total number of genes, average and standard deviation of exons per gene, and the highest number of predicted exons in a gene. 
Dependencies are the two included CSV files and the modules matplotlib, pandas, scikitlearn, statsmodels, and numpy
